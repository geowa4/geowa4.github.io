        George is a Software Craftsman living in Rochester, NY that dedicates himself to continuous improvement.
        Recognizing teaching as the best way to learn, George is a regular speaker at local conferences and tech meetups.
        He is the organizer of the Functional Programming meetup and regularly attends meetups focusing on JavaScript, Python, and Entrepreneurship.
        In an effort to bring together all people in development from the Greater Rochester area, George started a Slack community.

        Over the past few years, George has focused on the DevOps movement and Infrastructure as Code.
        This has led him to gain a greater appreciation of the entire web application stack and the nuances of distributed systems.
        Working horizontally across the Software Engineering organization has also led him to understand the complexities of software processes and how those complexities distill to deliver value to customers.
